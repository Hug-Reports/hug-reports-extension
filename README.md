### Say Thanks ###
*Send a token of your appreciation!* 
By clicking "Say Thanks", your appreciation will be sent. You have the option to add a personal note by clicking "Say More" or return to your program by clicking "Cancel".

### Say More ###
*Provide a personalized note to contributors.*
Once you click ‚ÄúSay More‚Äù, a new webview will appear with a form to fill out:
1. **Package name.** If you have more than one package imported on you line of code, select one to continue with the rest of the form.
   
2. **Module selection.** You can choose to select specific modules you‚Äôve used in your code, or thank the entire package.

3. **Github URL.** This field displays the URL for the repository of the package. You can edit + save the field if modifications are needed.

     If the extension cannot find the link to the repository, you can add it yourself by editing the field.
