### Say Thanks

_Send a token of your appreciation!_
By clicking "Say Thanks", your appreciation will be sent. You have the option to add a personal note by clicking "Say More" or return to your program by clicking "Cancel".

### Say More

_Provide a personalized note to contributors._
Once you click ‚ÄúSay More‚Äù, a new webview will appear with a form to fill out:

1. **Package name.** If you have more than one package imported on you line of code, select one to continue with the rest of the form.
2. **Module selection.** You can choose to select specific modules you‚Äôve used in your code, or thank the entire package.

   If the extension cannot find the link to the repository, you can add it yourself by editing the field.
